    <p><strong>Capricciosa Pizza</strong> is a classic Italian pizza variety known for its delightful combination of flavorful ingredients.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomato Sauce Base:
            A classic tomato sauce provides the foundational flavor for the pizza.</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese:

            Generous layers of fresh mozzarella cheese contribute a creamy and gooey texture as it melts during baking.</li>
        <li>Mushrooms:

            Sliced mushrooms, often sautéed beforehand, add an earthy and savory element to the pizza.</li>
        <li>Ham or Prosciutto:

            High-quality ham or prosciutto is a common protein topping, providing a salty and savory contrast to the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Artichokes:

            Artichoke hearts, either marinated or grilled, offer a slightly tangy and distinctive flavor.</li>
        <li>Black Olives:

            Black olives, pitted and sliced, contribute a briny and salty component to the overall taste profile.</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil:

            Sprigs or torn leaves of fresh basil are often added after baking, imparting a fragrant and herbaceous note.</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese:

            Grated Parmesan cheese may be sprinkled on top for an extra layer of rich, nutty flavor.</li>
        <li>Olive Oil:

            A drizzle of high-quality olive oil adds a finishing touch, enhancing the flavors and providing a glossy appearance.</li>

                <li>Distribute sauteed mushrooms, ham or prosciutto slices, sliced artichoke hearts, and black olives over the pizza.</li>
            </ul></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong></p>
            <p>Place the assembled pizza in the preheated oven and bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</p></li>
