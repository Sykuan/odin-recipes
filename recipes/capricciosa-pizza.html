        <li><p><strong>Clean and Season Duck:</strong></p>
             <p>Clean the duck thoroughly and pat it dry. Rub the duck, both inside and out, with a mixture of Chinese five-spice powder and salt. Allow it to air-dry in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare Glaze:</strong></p>
            <p>In a small bowl, mix honey, soy sauce, and rice vinegar to create a glaze.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Roast the Duck:</strong></p>
            <p>Place the seasoned duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Roast the duck in the preheated oven until the skin is crispy and golden. Baste the duck with the glaze during the last 15-20 minutes of roasting.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare Accompaniments:</strong></p>
            <p>While the duck is roasting, prepare the accompaniments. Slice the scallions, julienne the cucumber, and warm the thin pancakes or steamed buns.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Slice the Duck:</strong></p>
            <p>Once the duck is cooked, let it rest for a few minutes. Then, skillfully slice the duck into thin pieces, ensuring each slice has a mix of crispy skin and tender meat.</p></li>
